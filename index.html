        <p><small>While it is important to recognize that much of high fashion is in fact a facsimile of trends in lower classes adopted by top classes and then distributed to those in the middle, this is not new. If anything it’s always happened this way. That is something, I believe, to consider--perhaps in order to change it but don’t criticize you know? Criticize the system </small></p>

  class="tab">  Culture is paradoxically moving slower and faster now. You might have noticed comedically rapid influx of new memes but the same old shit on Instagram videos in your explore tab which is overpopulated by food and makeup videos. We made this list,, for your context,, in a Czech hotel themed bar in Montreal with stuffed ostrich heads all over the walls. We had these drinks: </p>
	    <p class="tab">   <b>H</b>elen: Jaeger and gingerbeer cocktail </p>
	    <p class="tab" <b>A</b>ndie: apple juice and vodka </p>
	   <p class="tab"  <b>M</b>iller: a Pint </p>
	   <p class="tab"  <b>M</b>addie: an old-fashioned</p>
	<p>Compared to previous lists, you may just think, “This just sounds like you are growing up”. That might be true, but it probably isn’t. Maybe a little. But I like to think that everyone is, also whatever is current and upcoming always seems to be of-the-moment and mature in a trend sense, so of course you think that. Anyway. Just a reminder that this list is observational and predictive NOT directive. Trends operate outside of us and through us, and to participate in them means little as to your self as a self. Sort of like a participatory weather, if you will.

            <strong>NOTES ON NEW SINCERITY:</strong><br />
As you may or may not have noticed, post-irony is out. I remember a time where it was cool to have a tongue-in-cheek t-shirt while you said “haha I’m gonna do -blank-”. Everyone’s tongues were really stuck in there! Except when explaining actions to ensure understanding of the action to avoid negative judgment.  LIke when you get your wisdom teeth out and you can’t stop touching the hole where they used to be with the tip of your tongue (which is always sort of recovering from burns from hot coffee). Everything was a Joke but now Everything is A Meme. HAven’t you noticed?
In a sense, post-irony was easy. Now things feel chaotic maybe, even if they are more direct. The directness, however, is new. Further, to separate the “new” from the “sincerity” would be a terrible mistake, so don’t try it. It would be like splitting an atom because sincerity has never fully existed outside of a specific and relative context maybe. I’m not sure I’ve only been around 21 years, and the others about the same. 
It’s also a mistake to separate New Sincerity from post-irony. They’re inextricably connection and don’t exist without each other which is sweet. I love it when the cultural trends kiss. They must kiss. Some more examples of post-irony:<br />
<li>making a thing out of making dinner
<li>taking a picture in front of the “Weed, California” sign (or similarly overdone and obvious landmark joke)--personal iterations are of course in as long as visual social media is
<li>only drinking bad cheap beer esp PBR and making a thing of it
<li>giving excuses of humor for listening to Weezer (or other “embarrassing” band--it’s not really embarrassing)
		<li><b><i>Sincerity as a joke</i></b></li><br />

<p>Notice how most of these involve “making a thing” of something. Not nothing! There is something there. It comes out of a combination of humor potential and insecurity--in post-irony one clings to the humor in order to dodge any judgment. Post-irony and New Sincerity, are however, not far removed. From “On Ketamine and Added Value”, </p>
	<blockquote>“Somewhere along the line it became acceptable to be authentic, earnest, honest, and sincere, even if the object of this sincerity is a complete celebration of consumerism.” </blockquote>

<p>Post ironic people often “against capitalism” easy to make joke--doesn’t absolve and partake in it silently just as much!!!! Assumed Silent absolution kisses silent complacency. Will be happier using consumerism to your advantage 
So really, they’re not that different because the sincerity is “new”. That is, it is itself something consumable and something to which one can attach themselves for social capital. Additionally, consumerism is safe. Much like attaching to humor in acts, in post-irony, people attach sincere acts to deep down consumerism as means of safety and non-judgment. Perhaps, however, this celebration of consumerism can also veil true sincerity between and among people. It will waver not switch, and it is heartening in an era where camp should be radical and action sincere. </p>
